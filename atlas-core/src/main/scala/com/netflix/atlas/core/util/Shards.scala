/**
  * Utility functions for mapping ids or indices to a shard. For our purposes, a shard
  * is an instance with a set of server groups. The union of data from all groups comprises
  * a full copy of the overall dataset. To allow for smaller deployment units, an individual
  * group or subset of the groups can be replicated. For redundancy, groups could be replicated
  * all the time. At Netflix, we typically replicate the overall set of server groups in
  * another region or zone instead.
  *
  * This class specifically focuses on relatively simple sharding schemes where the component
  * making the decision only needs to know the set of instances and a slot for each instance.
  * Edda is one example of a system that provides this information for AWS auto-scaling
  * groups. More complex sharding schemes that require additional infrastructure, e.g,
  * zookeeper, are out of scope here. There are two sharding modes supported by this
  * class:
  *
  * 1. Mapping an id for a tagged item to a shard. This is typically done while data
  *    is flowing into the system and each datapoint can be routed based on the id.
  *
  * 2. Mapping an positional index to a shard. This is typically done for loading data
  *    that has been processed via Hadoop or similar tools and stored in a fixed number
  *    of files. There should be a manifest with an order list of the files for a given
  *    time and the position can be used to map to a shard. When using this approach it
  *    is recommended to use a [highly composite number][hcn] for the number of files.
  *    This makes it easier to pick a number of groups and sizes for the groups such that
  *    each instance will get the same number of files.
  *
  * When mapping this to AWS an overall deployment is typically a set of auto-scaling groups
  * (ASG). Each instance should get the same amount of data if possible given the set of files.
  * Deployments are typically done as a red/black push of one ASG at a time. So the amount of
  * additional capacity during a push is the size of one of these groups if deployments across
  * the groups are performed serially. While multiple ASGs for a particular group are active
  * the data will be replicated across them.
