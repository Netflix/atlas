/**
  * If it is expensive to overwrite, then the immediate pass through behavior of

  * the last `n` values over time for a given normalization function. This is
  * typically to allow for use-cases where data may be reported on many nodes and
  * thus some data is received out of order with many values for a given time.
  *
  * @param step
  *     Step size between successive values.
  * @param size
  *     Size of the buffer.
  * @param next
  *     Normalized values will be passed to the this function.
