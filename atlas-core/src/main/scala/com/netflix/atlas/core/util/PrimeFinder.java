 * <p>Choosing prime numbers as hash table capacities is a good idea to keep them working fast,

 *
 * <p>However, JDK 1.2, JGL 3.1 and many other toolkits do nothing to keep capacities prime.
 * This class provides efficient means to choose prime capacities.

  /**
   * The prime number list consists of 11 chunks. Each chunk contains prime numbers. A chunk starts with a prime P1. The
   * next element is a prime P2. P2 is the smallest prime for which holds: P2 >= 2*P1. The next element is P3, for which
   * the same holds with respect to P2, and so on.
   *
   * Chunks are chosen such that for any desired capacity >= 1000 the list includes a prime number <= desired capacity *
   * 1.11 (11%). For any desired capacity >= 200 the list includes a prime number <= desired capacity * 1.16 (16%). For
   * any desired capacity >= 16 the list includes a prime number <= desired capacity * 1.21 (21%).
   *
   * Therefore, primes can be retrieved which are quite close to any desired capacity, which in turn avoids wasting
   * memory. For example, the list includes 1039,1117,1201,1277,1361,1439,1523,1597,1759,1907,2081. So if you need a
   * prime >= 1040, you will find a prime <= 1040*1.11=1154.
   *
   * Chunks are chosen such that they are optimized for a hashtable growthfactor of 2.0; If your hashtable has such a
   * growthfactor then, after initially "rounding to a prime" upon hashtable construction, it will later expand to prime
   * capacities such that there exist no better primes.
   *
   * In total these are about 32*10=320 numbers -> 1 KB of static memory needed. If you are stingy, then delete every
   * second or fourth chunk.
