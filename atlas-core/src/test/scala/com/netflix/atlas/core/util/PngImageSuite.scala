  // From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)
  val sampleText = """
    |In Greek mythology, Atlas (English pronunciation: /ˈætləs/, Greek. Ἄτλας)
    | was the primordial Titan who supported the heavens. Although associated
    | with various places, he became commonly identified with the Atlas
    | Mountains in northwest Africa (Modern-day Morocco and Algeria).
    | The etymology of the name Atlas is uncertain and still debated. Virgil
    | took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them
    | with adjectives that explained them: for Atlas his adjective is durus,
    | "hard, enduring", which suggested to George Doig that Virgil was aware of
    | the Greek τλήναι "to endure"; Doig offers the further possibility that
    | Virgil was aware of Strabo's remark that the native North African name
    | for this mountain was Douris. Since the Atlas mountains rise in the
    | region inhabited by Berbers, it has been suggested that the name might be
    | taken from one of the Berber languages, specifically adrar, Berber for
    | "mountain".
