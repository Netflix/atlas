/**
  * Experimental variant of json encoding. The format is not yet final and may change. Goals:
  *
  * - Include all metadata so the output can be used to precisely recreate the image. This is
  *   useful for debugging and allows dynamic rendering to be more precise.
  *
  * - Must be parseable with a standard json parser. The default json format encodes NaN and
  *   Infinity without quotes so it cannot be used without parser extensions. The std.json format
  *   fixes that, but in all new formats they should be standard for the json encoding.
  *
  * - Allow the data to be incrementally returned. With many of the existing formats the entire
  *   payload must be ready before we can output data. As data volumes get bigger it is
  *   necessary to be able to emit data as it becomes available.
  *
  * - Allow for incremental evaluation of the data over time. The constant metadata for the
  *   chart should be written out first. Data can arrive over time. For example, in a streaming
  *   execution we might get data for all lines for a given minute, then the next minute, and
  *   so on.
  *
  * - Consistent where possible to the SSE payloads from the fetch API.
