/**
  * Category of metrics to fetch from cloudwatch. This will typically correspond with
  * a CloudWatch namespace, though there may be multiple categories per namespace if
  * there is some variation in the behavior. For example, some namespaces will use a
  * different period for some metrics.
  *
  * @param namespace
  *     CloudWatch namespace for the data.
  * @param period
  *     How frequently data in this category is updated. Atlas is meant for data that
  *     is continuously reported and requires a consistent step. To minimize confusion
  *     for cloudwatch data we use the last reported value in cloudwatch as long as it
  *     is within one period from the polling time. The period is also needed for
  *     performing rate conversions on some metrics.
  * @param dimensions
  *     The dimensions to query for when getting data from cloudwatch. For the
  *     GetMetricData calls we have to explicitly specify all of the dimensions. In some
  *     cases CloudWatch has duplicate data for pre-computed aggregates. For example,
  *     ELB data is reported overall for the load balancer and by zone. For Atlas it
  *     is better to map in the most granular form and allow the aggregate to be done
  *     dynamically at query time.
  * @param metrics
  *     The set of metrics to fetch and metadata for how to convert them.
  * @param filter
  *     Query expression used to select the set of metrics which should get published.
  *     This can sometimes be useful for debugging or if there are many "spammy" metrics
  *     for a given category.
